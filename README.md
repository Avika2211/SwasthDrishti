CV Applications- Learnt from freecodecamp.org ki DL Scikit and opencv wali video- VERYYYY FUN
This project uses Deep Learning to classify medical images as Healthy or Diseased using a ResNet-50 model.

What This Project Does
Loads a pre-trained ResNet-50 model and fine-tunes it for binary classification (Healthy/Diseased).

Takes a medical scan as input and predicts whether the patient is healthy or needs further diagnosis.

Uses PyTorch for model inference and PIL for image preprocessing.

Tech Stack
Python

PyTorch (Deep Learning Framework)

Torchvision (Pre-trained ResNet-50 Model)

Pillow (PIL) (For Image Processing)
